Notice:
The Demo-Document is a great starting point:
- pipWindow + audioOnly + Automation-Layer = One element at the matrix.
- You can add as many pipWindow and audio-only- Layers as your Mac can handle. You have to add buttons at the Web Control.
- If you remove Layers from the demo, you might have to remove these also from WebControl.
